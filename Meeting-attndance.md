## Meeting attendance

This week I attended a meeting on the 6th from 10 to 11 am​ at the launch of the CPL Play program and the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Cambodian Premier League and Stadiumx.
At Raintree Cambodia. When I attended the program, I felt that it was really good for me because it made me know and get to know new things for me and had the opportunity to learn about teamwork​ and incorporate good ideas  and listen to good comments from the meeting. I felt that I have increased my knowledge and gained many good experiences in this meeting. Although it was short, it made me understand more and got to know the people around me more. I hope to have the opportunity to attendance more meetings to develop myself further.

## Overall, in this meeting

This meeting gave me something new and new experience because I have never participated in such a meeting before. I also received good lessons for my further development.
