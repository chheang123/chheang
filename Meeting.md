# Meeting attendance

This week I attended a meeting on the 6th from 10 to 11 am​ at the launch of the CPL Play program and the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Cambodian Premier League and Stadiumx.
At Raintree Cambodia. When I attended the program, I felt that it was really good for me because it made me know and get to know something ​new for me and had the opportunity to learn about teamwork​ and incorporate good ideas  and listen to good comments from the meeting. I felt that I have increased my knowledge and gained many good experiences. I hope to have the opportunity to attend more meetings to develop myself further.
